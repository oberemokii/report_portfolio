# üìä Project Portfolio Dashboard (Power BI)

## What
This repository contains an example **Power BI dashboard** that helps **company executives monitor and analyze the implementation of a project portfolio**. It is special because it consolidates project performance data (deadlines, costs, tasks, and resource allocation) into one place and provides multiple analytical views:

- **Main**: Portfolio overview with deviations in time, cost, and execution. High-level tasks are also displayed with deviation metrics.
